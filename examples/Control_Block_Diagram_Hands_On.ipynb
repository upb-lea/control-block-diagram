    "The control-block-diagram package is a Python Toolbox for drawing block diagrams. It is build upon [Pylatex](https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/), and therefore, can generate Latex files and also PDF files. It allows you to construct typical control block diagrams with the usual building blocks, i.e., PI-Controllers, Adders, Multiplier. It is also possible to define own blocks.\n",
